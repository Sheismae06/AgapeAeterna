    <p class="fade-in">Agape Aeterna was born from a deep love for fragrance — not just any scent, but the kind that lingers, speaks softly, and leaves a lasting impression.</p>
    <p class="fade-in">For me, perfume is more than just something you wear. It’s a quiet reflection of who you are — a memory, a mood, a presence that stays even after you’ve left the room.</p>
    <p class="fade-in">The name <span class="highlight">Agape Aeterna</span> means eternal, unconditional love. It reflects who I am and what I hope to share through this brand. I want every scent to make people feel special, confident, and remembered — even without saying a word.</p>
